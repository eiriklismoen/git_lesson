# GITHUB! A "dropbox for Git repositories"... and so much more
Open a new repository at your GitHub profile
Follow the guidelines (if pushing an existing repository, makes sure to be in that respective directory)
- Will probably be prompted to type in username: eiriklismoen and GitHub-password...
When pushed successfully the local directory can be removed with the following commands:
cd .. - to get back to the Desktop directory
rm -rf git_lesson - to remove recursively and forcefully

Clone from GitHub to local:
Copy the respective SSH-code to the clipboard
git clone 'paste' (in the terminal)

Push to GitHub (after committing changes):
git push - pushes changes to GitHub
(will receive a lot of unnecessary errors, can be omitted with 'git config --global push.default simple' for future use)

Adding collaborators (for repository):
Settings -> Manage access -> Invite a collaborator -> Type in Username/email

Pulling (latest) repository:
git pull

NOTE: In order to 'push' we must always be on the latest repository
thus, we must first 'pull' and commit (i.e. resolve any conflicts before 'push')

Conflict in file edits (if '! [rejected]' when trying to 'push', 'pull' first, then:
git mergetool - merge as before...
git push
